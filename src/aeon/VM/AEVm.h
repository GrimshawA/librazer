/**
	\class aeon_vm
	\brief The vm is in charge of executing the program in its byte code form

	The responsibility of the vm is to execute bytecode from the aeon language. With the exception of JIT
	compiled native code, once the host application gives control to an AEON function, the vm will be processing
	the byte code to do so, potentially calling into native code halfway.

	The vm also takes control of managing the multiple hardware threads launched from the language and employ all mechanisms 
	specified by the language and standard libraries.

	Different vm can be instanced but they need to be executing on different programs, its unsafe to use two different vm to call into
	the same modules. For virtually all applications, only one vm is needed and it will take care of everything.

	[Threads]
	The vm operates directly on the caller thread until vm inner threads are launched. When such happens,
	the new threads will be managed by the VM and run effectively new threads, managed by the vm automatically.

	The vm has one stack for itself, for the main host thread, and an additional independent stack per hardware thread launched.

	[Coroutines]
	Coroutines are implemented by preservation of call state for restoration.
