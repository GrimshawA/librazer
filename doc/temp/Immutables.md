Tech Generator - Immutables
===========================


The concept of an immutable is a structural component of the application source code which does not change
regardless of the optimization technique chosen by the tech generator.

Regardless of the reason why some aspects become immutables, they are an anchor point for the
generation technology to have consistency and starting points for generating everything else around.

These are also a point of predictability for the developer working alongside raven.

One great example of an immutable from the C++/Qt generator is the data model. For every single view 
in a C++ app, the underlying data is fed to it via the same immutable, the data model.

In essence, the data model will always be an instance of a class generated by raven, which follows the contract of raven.qt.model. This includes having as base class QAbstractItemModel and following other property conventions of raven.

Under it, it can be the most straightforward data access or a very complex world of optimizations. Nevertheless,
it will look very simple for the client code of said data model.
