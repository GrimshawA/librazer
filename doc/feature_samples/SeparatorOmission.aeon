It is not necessary to delimitate statements with ; 
whenever the context can be understood through newlines and other cues.

Most typically, code is single line statements, and in that case the statement doesn't need to end in a ;

function HelloWorld()
{
	if(a==b)
		doThings() // no need for ;, the newline acts as delimiter

	testThis()
	testThat()
	a = b
}
