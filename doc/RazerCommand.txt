RazerVM command - rzr
----------------

The rzr command is the standardized way to run razer programs targeting the RazerVM. Programs are compiled into modules which must be loaded
by the vm to execute.

There is always the option to manually create a new project that hosts the vm in order to boostrap execution in the app itself, rather than having to invoke rzr.

However, during development, demos and utilities, most programs will use rzr to launch the vm.

Launching from source
----------------------

In order to have rzr directly compile and execute an input file, do:

rzr sourcefile.rz

The main function will be executed and the program will run.

Launching from module
-----------------------

Run the vm by loading a precompiled program module where the main resides. Modules have links to their dependencies so those are loaded automatically.

rzr app.dll
